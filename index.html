    <p>
        Hello!
        <br>
        I'm Jacob, or codist as I'm known online.
        <br>
        I am a programmer located in Canada.
        <br><br>
        I like to create random <a href="/projects/">projects or games</a> just for the fun of it,
        even if they aren't particularly useful.
        <br><br>
        If you would like to chat with me about anything, I have a <a href="https://twitter.com/ImCodist">Twitter</a> where we can do so.
    </p>
