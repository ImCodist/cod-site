Hello? Is this thing on? Good!

## Welcome to my blog!

I'm going to be posting semi frequently here as a way to update those interested in my work. I'd like to have a decent place to dump everything in like progress reports, release info, stuff like that. So thats... this!

Don't expect professionalism with this as that isn't the way I work. I might just make a post about how much I like Super Mario one day and **YOU'LL** HAVE TO LISTEN *MWAHAHAHAHA*.

## What to expect.

Information you can expect from this blog is:
- Project Updates
- Social Media Updates
- Slice Of Life Stuffs
- Things I Find Interesting
- Game Reviews?
- And more stuff I can't think of right now

There is a lot to look forward to if you are a fan of anti-social teenagers with too much time on their hands... wait what?

## Closing Thoughts

I hope you like my little blog thing and look forward to more content in the future!

I'm personally really excited to start posting here so I don't have to rely so heavily on a *certain social media run by certain emerald mine owner*.

I am going to go back to playing Factorio now I've been trying to automate these science packs but they require a lot of resources which I don't make enough of, so I have had the game idle in the background writing this trying to research a gate which by the way still hasn't been finished im not even going to use it i already killed all the aliens around my base so its not like i need to keep anything out of it right now god dam nit
