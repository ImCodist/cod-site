B-LEAP is a survival game where everything is a bouncy ball!

In B-LEAP you use trampolines to leap around the stage collecting coins to buy upgrades (and if you get unlucky some downgrades)!

This game was made for the [GMTK 2020 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2020), the theme was "Out of Control."

## Gameplay

The game is a simple high score based game. Your goal is to get as far as you can without losing all of your lifes.

You do not control the player character directly, instead you use "trampolines" to direct the player towards your desired destination.

Each wave spawns enemies overtime, these enemies need to be defeated to end the wave. Enemies drop coins and occasionally hearts to help you progress farther into the game. 

After killing enough enemies your special meter will fill up, allowing you to summon a wave which kills enemies nearby.

Coins can be used to give a random upgrade or downgrade to your player.
