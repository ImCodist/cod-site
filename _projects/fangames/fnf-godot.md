A Friday Night Funkin' Godot Remake is another remake of Friday Night Funkin'.

I did this for a big mod I wanna do and that still may happen, but I dont know anymore honestly.<br>
I like FNF.

### Update
[That mod](https://twitter.com/ImCodist/status/1620222422795558913?s=20) didn't happen and ended up being canned.
